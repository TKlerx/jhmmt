/**
 * This class implements a {@link OpdfGaussian} reader.  The syntax of the
 * distribution description is the following.
 * <p>
 * The description always begins with the keyword <tt>GaussianOPDF</tt>.
 * The next (resp. last) symbol is an opening (resp. closing) bracket.
 * Between the backets are two numbers separated by a space.  The
 * first is the distribution's mean, the second the variance.
 * <p>
 * For example, reading <tt>GaussianOPDF [ .2 .3 ]</tt> returns a distribution
 * equivalent to <code>new OpdfGaussian(.2, .3)</code>.
