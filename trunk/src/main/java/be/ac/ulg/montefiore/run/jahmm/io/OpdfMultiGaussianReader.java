/**
 * This class implements a {@link OpdfMultiGaussian} reader.  The syntax of the
 * distribution description is the following.
 * <p>
 * The description always begins with the keyword <tt>MultiGaussianOPDF</tt>.
 * The next (resp. last) symbol is an opening (resp. closing) bracket.
 * Between the backets are two series of numbers between brackets and separated
 * by a space.
 * <p>
 * The first describes the distribution's mean vector; each number
 * is the corresponding vector element, from top to bottom.
 * <p>
 * The second describes the covariance matrix; it is given line by line, from
 * top to bottom. Each line is represented by the values of its elements, from
 * left to right, separated by a space and between brackets.  
 * <p>
 * For example, reading<br>
 * <tt>MultiGaussianOPDF [ [ 5. 5. ] [ [ 1.2 .3 ] [ .3 4. ] ] ]</tt>
 * returns a distribution equivalent to<br>
 * <code>new OpdfMultiGaussian(new double[] { 5., 5. },
 *       new double[][] { { 1.2, .3 }, { .3, 4. } })</code>.
