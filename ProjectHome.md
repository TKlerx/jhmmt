This library is a fork of jahmm ( https://code.google.com/p/jahmm ) since jahmm seems not to be developed any longer.

The downloads are now available on the left under "External Links" (google changed this).

This library requires the external libraries Apache commons lang (v3.1) and Apache commons math (v3.2).
There is one version with the packaged apache libraries (ends with "runnable") and one version without the packaged libaries (ends with "bin"). If you use the latter one you have to add apache commons math and lang to your applications classpath yourself (see the External Link section for downloads).
